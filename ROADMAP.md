## Current State (Baseline)

The core product is feature-complete and well-architected:

- 5 fully implemented tabs (Practice, Progress, Tuner, MetroDrone, Settings)
- 7 quiz focus modes + 4 game modes + adaptive weighting
- Bayesian mastery algorithm with 6×12 heatmap
- Live pitch detection (AccelerateYIN)
- Metronome + drone generator (AVAudioEngine)
- SwiftData persistence + repository pattern
- 219 unit tests (3 pre-existing failures unrelated to feature work)
- Full audio calibration system (F22) — required before quiz, pre-seeds PitchDetector
- Advanced pitch detection: spectral flatness gate, consecutive frame gate, HPS octave verification, string-aware frequency constraints, 50 Hz HPF, input-source-aware low-frequency emphasis, adaptive spectral subtraction, distortion tolerance (crest factor, harmonic regularity, input-aware flatness threshold), tuner sustain hysteresis (F29)
- Piano drone timbre (F26), practice streak tracker (F27), tap mode bypass for calibration (F28)
- Swift 6 strict concurrency

> **Product name decided**: FretShed: Guitar Fretboard · Bundle ID: `com.jpm.fretshed` (locked in App Store Connect)

## How to Use This Roadmap

Work through phases in order — each phase builds on the last. Do not jump to Phase 4 (Monetization) until Phases 1–3 are solid.

For each task, open Claude Code and say:

> "Help me complete task [number]: [task name]"

Then share the relevant Swift files. Every task on this list is Claude-assisted — you do not need to write code from scratch.

Mark tasks complete by changing `🔲` to `✅` as you go. When a full phase is done, that's a real milestone worth acknowledging.

**You already built the hard parts. Everything here is execution, not invention.**
